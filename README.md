# Vrinda Store Data Analysis using Excel
Objective:- 
Vrinda Store wants to create an annual sales report for 2023 to gain a deeper understanding of their customers behavior, inventory management and to give valuable insights to drive sales growth. 

Key Insights:-
1. Women are more likely to buy compared to men (~65%)

2. Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh are the top 3 states (~35)

3. Adult age group (30-49 yrs) is max contributing (~50%)

4. Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra channels are max contributing (~80)

Recommendation:-
In the end, my recommendation for Vrinda store was to focus on Women candidate of Adult age group as they had highest(34%) contribution to sales by showing offers on channels like Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra. Also, as Vrinda made fewer sales in the last quarter of 2022, so in the next year they can give more offers to the customer in this time period to increase sales.
